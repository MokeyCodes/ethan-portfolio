## 🌟 About

This portfolio showcases the websites and projects I've built as a student, including:

- 🧠 [Brighter Futures Tutoring](https://brighterfuturestutoring.org): A full-stack educational platform built using Moodle, Redis caching, MariaDB, and deployed on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) using DigitalOcean. Domain and DNS were configured using GoDaddy, including authenticated email delivery via SendGrid. The homepage and front-end content are being continuously updated as features are rolled out.
- 💻 **CS Honor Society Project**: A website created for my high school’s CS Honor Society Club to promote events and club members.
- 🧾 **Professional Web Portfolio**: A collection of HTML projects and assignments completed during my college dual enrollment course.

The portfolio was created using basic HTML/CSS and is hosted with GitHub Pages.

## 🎓 About Me

I'm an incoming freshman at UC San Diego, where I plan to major in Artificial Intelligence. This portfolio highlights the work I've done prior to starting college, including full-stack development, website design, and real-world projects built through dual-enrollment courses and independent learning. I’ve also deployed and managed a live tutoring platform using a VPS, demonstrating hands-on experience with web servers and deployment.
