    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a developer passionate about building practical, real-world systems. Alongside Marc Taytayan, I co-developed a live tutoring platform using Moodle, hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS. I’ve worked with cloud servers, DNS, SSL, server-side caching, automated backups, and email integration using SendGrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created this portfolio to showcase my personal projects, classwork, and collaboration experience. I'm currently preparing to begin my studies at UC San Diego.
